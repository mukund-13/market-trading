Project Title: Real-Time Market Data Analysis and Automated Trading System

Objective:
Develop a high-performance, real-time market data analysis and trading system using C++. The system will process live market data, apply quantitative trading strategies, and execute trades with minimal latency. The project will demonstrate skills in C++ programming, financial data processing, algorithmic trading, and real-time system development.
Detailed Project Outline
1. System Architecture

Components:

    Market Data Feed Handler: Connects to market data providers (e.g., stock exchanges, financial data APIs) to receive real-time market data.
    Data Processing Engine: Processes incoming market data, updates internal state, and computes necessary indicators.
    Trading Strategy Module: Implements one or more trading algorithms that generate buy/sell signals based on processed data.
    Order Execution Engine: Interfaces with a simulated or real trading platform to place, modify, and cancel orders.
    Risk Management Module: Monitors positions and risk metrics to ensure compliance with predefined risk parameters.
    Dashboard Interface: Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to monitor system performance, view trading signals, and manage settings.

    Optional: Machine learning (dlib, TensorFlow C++ API)

5. Order Execution Engine

Tasks:

    Interface with trading APIs (e.g., Interactive Brokers, Alpaca) to send and manage orders.
    Implement order types (market, limit, stop) and execution logic.
    Ensure low-latency order processing and robust error handling.

Technologies:

    API integration (REST APIs, FIX protocol)
    Low-latency programming (optimizing network and I/O operations)

6. Risk Management Module

Tasks:

    Monitor real-time positions, P&L, and risk metrics (e.g., VaR, max drawdown).
    Implement risk limits and automated safeguards (e.g., stop-loss orders).
    Provide real-time alerts and logging for risk events.

Technologies:

    Risk calculations (custom C++ code)
    Logging and alerts (Boost.Log, email/SMS integration)

7. Dashboard Interface

Tasks:

    Develop a GUI to visualize market data, trading signals, and system performance.
    Provide interactive controls for strategy parameters and risk settings.
    Display real-time metrics and alerts.
